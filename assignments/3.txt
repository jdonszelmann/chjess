1.1:

using :hover in index.js for the game start buttons
using ::after  in .gameplayBox::after to add exclaimation marks. totally unnecessary but it shows the working...
using margin, padding basically everywhere (but also grid) padding for example in gameplaybox (index.css)
using position relative/absolute/fixed/auto 
animations for hovering and for loading of data from the server (private lobby ling)

1.2:

coherent: not really... but at least we didn't duplicate any css because the game doesnt use any css.... all js and canvas :)

âœ“

1.3:

media queries are used to block input and display a message when the screen gets too small. example: public/single/index.html (see style tag)

âœ“

1.4:

just press f11 you know... everything works fine!

1.5:

2: 

lobby uses ejs to display the title. again totally useless but it shows the working of ejs. in game pages there is no need since there barely is any html

âœ“

3:

we use tons of cookies including game access and many from the google login system

âœ“

4: tested in chrome, edge, firefox and safari. works in fullscreen mode (windows: f11). runs on most touchscreen devices with the notable exception of many iphones.

but hey, who cares about apple anyways

5:

deployed on our own 24/7 webserver.
